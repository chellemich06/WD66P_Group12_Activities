						<h3>Profile</h3>
						<p>	Hi, I am one of many who dream to achieve something big in their lives. 
						The one who is very passionate about what his doing whether it is difficult or not, 
						he gave more effort than anybody else.<br><br>I, Paine Jay Lumantam Fadri and believe that whosoever pursues 
						about their dreams to make them come true will never have an easy path. 
						There will be times that it will let you down and even tells you to give up. 
						But never worry about that for it is part of your success 
						that when you already achieve what you desire, you are already prepared mentally,
						physically and spiritually firm to accept what has been granted over you.</p>

								<h3>Kitchen Crew</h3>
									<p>	Way back that year, I was so excited about my first job. 
								Being a kitchen crew is not an easy task for you need to be focused at 
								all times and never let the food be under cook or over cook. It was a 
								very productive day and it helps me to handle pressure easily, and now even if
								I'm not working there anymore I still do the things that I have 
								learn in my daily life. it saddens me that I no longer work over there but don't worry,
								because just like what they always say, nothing lasts forever, if you see that you are
								no longer growing in that place and see a better opportunity then just go for it.</p>

								<h5>BPO Call Center</h5>

							<div class="text">
								<h3>Virtual Assistant</h3>
									<p>	An outsourced call center will help you with advice for any issues, and will add to 
								the range of exchanges with clients. Large companies, however efficient they may be, 
								have the need for service providers combining teams trained to deal professionally with 
								any situation, the mastery of abundant technological innovations and a seamless organization 
								combining the two as closely as possible to the needs of each client. The evolution of the 
								call center sector is changing the paradigms. You may worry, "How can the vertiginous turnover
								often experienced by this profession leave any chance of success in ambitious client relations 
								policies. Therefore, wages are, of course, usually a majority of the expenses of service providers. 
								Reducing them would save commercial costs, but may also negatively impact all the brand's customers. 
								To do this, you must involve both proven commercial skills and experienced commercial leadership.
								But who believes that by hurriedly recruiting, waiting for immediate results, training too fast and 
								too little, exerting constant pressure on their teams and paying too low a salary, one has the slightest 
								chance of getting a quality image and satisfied customers? The first issue, as we have seen, is the limitation
								of cost. To solve this difficulty, the solution is to set up an outsourced call center sales team and not 
								a single self-sufficient individual. Professionalize your business. Whether you create your outsourced
								call center sales force or reinforce it punctually on a new market sector, you can not afford to have an amateur approach.</p>
